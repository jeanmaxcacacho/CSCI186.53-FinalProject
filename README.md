### Hello ðŸ‘‹
For Git/GitHub integration in Remix I was able to find [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNKv3ysoVeE).
To make your development environment clean also you should create a dedicated workspace
for this project in Remix. To do this click on the hamburger icon below the "FILE EXPLORER"
and the left of the "Workspaces" labels at the top left section. After that select the option
to clone the repository, paste in the URL and you should be good to go.
